			<strong>Sales Data Analysis<br></strong>
			<br/>
		</h1>
		<p style="text-align: center;">
			Welcome to our Sales Data Analysis project! In this project, we have conducted an in-depth analysis of sales data for the year 2019. Our main objective is to analyze 12 separate CSV files containing sales data for each month from January 2019 to December 2019. Using Python and various data cleaning, manipulation, and wrangling techniques, we have consolidated the data into a single CSV file.
			<br><br>
			<strong>
				<mark>Key Features of the Project:</mark>
			</strong>
			<ul>
				Thorough analysis of sales data CSV files.<br>
				Answering important questions to extract valuable insights.<br>
				Visualizing the data to uncover patterns and trends.<br>
				Providing meaningful interpretations and recommendations based on the analysis.
			</ul>
			<br>
			<strong>
				<mark>Why Sales Data Analysis is Important:<br></mark>
			</strong>
			Sales data analysis plays a vital role in understanding business performance, identifying areas of growth, and making data-driven decisions. By analyzing sales data, we can gain insights into the best-performing months, top-selling cities, optimal timing for advertisements, frequently sold products together, and factors contributing to high sales volume. This information helps organizations optimize their sales strategies, identify opportunities for improvement, and drive overall business success.
